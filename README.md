## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the hidden structures and patterns within textual data using network analysis and word frequency techniques. The goal? To identify **prominent keyword associations** and map out **semantic relationships** that power modern NLP applications.

We dive deep into:
- Co-occurrence matrix construction
- Weighted network graph visualization
- Top-n keyword frequency extraction
- Contextual keyword mapping

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

This analysis supports real-world use cases such as:
- **🧠 Topic Modeling**: Reveal dominant themes in datasets
- **🔎 Search Optimization**: Enhance information retrieval via context-aware keywords
- **📝 Text Summarization**: Surface essential concepts quickly
- **📚 Domain Terminology Mining**: Understand linguistic patterns in specific fields

---

## 📈 Business Value

Imagine a tech firm analyzing customer support tickets:  
> With co-occurrence mapping, you'd know which pain points cluster together — leading to smarter product updates and better support workflows.

Or a legal team reviewing massive documents:  
> Keyword networks flag recurring legal clauses and concepts — boosting contract review speed and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- Tokenization and lemmatization using **NLTK**
- Co-occurrence matrix with **window-based proximity**
- Network graphs with **NetworkX** (weighted edges, labeled nodes)
- Keyword filtering via **stopword removal + frequency thresholds**
- Visualization using **Matplotlib** for interpretability
