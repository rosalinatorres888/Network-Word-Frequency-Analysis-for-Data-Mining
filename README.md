## üìå Overview
This project applies network science and text mining to uncover semantic relationships within a dataset of academic article metadata. By modeling co-occurrence patterns among keywords, I identified emergent themes, semantic bridges, and topic centrality. The result is a network graph where:
- **Nodes** = individual keywords  
- **Edges** = frequency of co-occurrence  
- **Edge Weights** = strength of keyword connection
## Network Visualization

This project includes network analysis of keyword co-occurrences. Here's a visualization of the network:

This project demonstrates how data mining and visualization can enhance content discovery, research mapping, and thematic analysis.

## üéØ Objective
Construct a weighted, undirected graph that reveals latent thematic structures by:
- Representing keywords as nodes
- Connecting co-occurring keywords within the same article
- Quantifying edge strength based on frequency
- Identifying central concepts and thematic clusters within the literature

---

## üîç Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
   - Gathered metadata from academic articles including titles, abstracts, and keywords
   - Performed data quality assessment and cleaning
   - Standardized formatting and resolved inconsistencies in keyword representation

2. **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**
   - Lowercasing and punctuation removal
   - Tokenization with special handling for multi-word phrases
   - Stopword removal using customized NLTK lists
   - Lemmatization to normalize word forms
   - N-gram identification for compound terms

3. **Keyword Extraction & Analysis**
   - Extracted author-assigned keywords from article metadata
   - Applied frequency analysis to identify prominent terms
   - Generated descriptive statistics (distribution, variance, etc.)
   - Identified core vocabulary across the corpus

4. **Co-occurrence Matrix Construction**
   - Generated all possible keyword pairs within each document
   - Built symmetric co-occurrence matrix tracking frequency
   - Applied normalization techniques to account for varying keyword frequencies
   - Filtered low-frequency co-occurrences to reduce noise

5. **Network Modeling & Analysis**
   - Converted co-occurrence matrix to weighted graph structure
   - Computed graph metrics:
     - Node-level metrics: degree, eigenvector centrality, betweenness
     - Network-level metrics: density, diameter, modularity
   - Applied community detection algorithms (Louvain method)
   - Identified influential nodes and structural patterns

6. **Visualization Development**
   - Created force-directed layouts to represent network structure
   - Implemented size and color encoding to represent metrics
   - Developed interactive components for exploration
   - Generated interpretable visual outputs for analysis
